## The Problem AKA Why does this matter?
The world of artists is characterized by financial hardship and uncertainty that transcends borders. A vast majority of artists worldwide grapple with the challenge of making a living from their craft, irrespective of cultural and language differences. This global issue calls for an all-encompassing solution that empowers artists and acknowledges their contributions, regardless of their location.

The prevalence of financial insecurity among artists is a harsh reality, with many struggling to make ends meet. A 2017 Artfinder study revealed that 75% of artists worldwide earned less than $10,000 annually from their art, and nearly half earned no more than $5,000. Female artists, in particular, face acute financial instability, with 83.6% earning less than $10,000. This lack of stable income takes a significant toll on artists' mental health, as a 2022 Record Union study found that 73% of independent musicians experienced stress, anxiety, and depression related to their work. These challenges are a universal experience for artists worldwide.

Despite their financial struggles, artists play a crucial role in enriching our lives and shaping our world. Their creative expressions serve as a source of inspiration, a medium for social commentary, and a bridge across cultures. They challenge our perspectives, expand our horizons, and connect us to our shared humanity.
