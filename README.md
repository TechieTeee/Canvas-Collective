# Canvas Collective

## Overview
Canvas Collective is a platform designed to address the financial challenges faced by artists worldwide. It empowers artists to secure financial stability, connect with art enthusiasts, and showcase their work. By embracing the concept of universal basic income (UBI) and leveraging cutting-edge technology, Canvas Collective opens new doors for artists, regardless of their geographical location. It's where art, community, and financial security converge.

## Key Features
- **Financial Empowerment:** Canvas Collective provides artists with a dependable income source, alleviating financial stress and enabling them to focus on their craft.

## The Problem
The world of artists is characterized by financial hardship and uncertainty that transcends borders. A vast majority of artists worldwide grapple with the challenge of making a living from their craft, irrespective of cultural and language differences. This global issue calls for an all-encompassing solution that empowers artists and acknowledges their contributions, regardless of their location.

The prevalence of financial insecurity among artists is a harsh reality, with many struggling to make ends meet. A 2017 Artfinder study revealed that 75% of artists worldwide earned less than $10,000 annually from their art, and nearly half earned no more than $5,000. Female artists, in particular, face acute financial instability, with 83.6% earning less than $10,000. This lack of stable income takes a significant toll on artists' mental health, as a 2022 Record Union study found that 73% of independent musicians experienced stress, anxiety, and depression related to their work. These challenges are a universal experience for artists worldwide.

Despite their financial struggles, artists play a crucial role in enriching our lives and shaping our world. Their creative expressions serve as a source of inspiration, a medium for social commentary, and a bridge across cultures. They challenge our perspectives, expand our horizons, and connect us to our shared humanity.
